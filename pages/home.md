# Hey! I'm David.

I'm a research scientist at <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/" style="color: #F15A29;">Cerebras Systems</a>, where I develop high-performance scientific applications for the <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/chip" style="color: #C43100;">Wafer-Scale Engine</a>. I also wrote some of the world's fastest libraries for [high-precision math](https://github.com/dzhang314/MultiFloats.jl) and [nonlinear optimization](https://github.com/dzhang314/DZOptimization.jl) and discovered new state-of-the-art algorithms for [floating-point arithmetic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3712285.3759876) and [solving differential equations](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11075-024-01783-2?sharing_token=DIlIxBaNaNyJqWcqV0F2ive4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY74IBoC9BA_hpOcYM1f7su40YlhXvIVC74zhMpmMZ5xdlAKVmZZvWdSyanLDcs1m9EsXa0VD8Wkp7wu6gjb54ErZI9MGQpbz8p2etxrsg-uAn6GM0xDVeRXb2d4Gmqg1jM%3D).

I recently graduated with a Ph\.D\. from the <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu/" style="color: #D17D00;">Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" style="color: #B83A4B;">Stanford University</a>. You've probably seen me if you live in the area --- I'm the guy with the big hair and the ukulele. On the rare occasion that I wasn't holding an impromptu uke concert, I also <a href="https://stanfordotone.com/" style="color: #1277B0;">directed an a cappella group</a> and <a href="https://ramshead.stanford.edu/" style="color: #6A00B5;">performed in musical theatre productions</a>.

I previously studied mathematics, physics, computer science, and scientific computing at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" style="color: #BF9539;">Vanderbilt University</a>. If you were a freshman in 2015, you might have known me as the guy who played guitar in the Hank House north stairwell.
