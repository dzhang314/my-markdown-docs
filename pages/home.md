# Hey! I'm David.

This is where you'll find the things I do and the notes I write.

I'm a sixth-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" style="color: #B83A4B;">Stanford University</a> in the <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu/" style="color: #d17d00;">Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering</a>. You've probably seen me if you live in the area --- I'm the guy with the big hair and the ukulele. On the rare occasion that I'm not holding an impromptu uke concert, I also <a href="https://stanfordotone.com/" style="color: #1277b0;">direct an a cappella group</a> and <a href="https://ramshead.stanford.edu/" style="color: #6a00b5;">perform in musical theatre productions</a>.

I previously studied mathematics, physics, computer science, and scientific computing at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" style="color: #bf9539;">Vanderbilt University</a>. If you were a freshman in 2015, you might have known me as the guy who played guitar in the Hank House north stairwell. (I had to downsize when I flew out to Cali; couldn't fit my guitar on the plane.)
