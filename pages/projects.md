<h1 class="page-title">Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on.</h1>

I'm currently working with [Alex Aiken](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/) to design and implement a [linear solver library](https://github.com/dzhang314/LegionSolvers) for the [Legion parallel programming system](https://legion.stanford.edu/).

In the spring of 2020, I worked with the [LCLS Advanced Methods Group](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/) to develop an iterative inversion algorithm for the [non-uniform fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_discrete_Fourier_transform), targeting applications in [single-molecule diffraction imaging](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1513738112) as part of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/exafel).

I also develop open-source scientific software in my spare time. I'm the author of several [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages, all available in [the general Julia package registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General).

 * [**MultiFloats.jl**](https://github.com/dzhang314/MultiFloats.jl) is the world's fastest* library for extended-precision floating-point arithmetic.
 * [**DZOptimization.jl**](https://github.com/dzhang314/DZOptimization.jl) is a high-performance library for smooth local nonlinear optimization.
 * [**RungeKuttaToolKit.jl**](https://github.com/dzhang314/RungeKuttaToolKit.jl) is a library of tools for deriving new Runge--Kutta methods.
 * [**AssemblyView.jl**](https://github.com/dzhang314/AssemblyView.jl) is a utility for displaying, analyzing, and summarizing x86 assembly code.

(*At least, it's the fastest library that I know of!)
