# Get to know me.

I was born on April 18<sup>th</sup>, 1997 to my incredibly loving and supportive parents, Dong Zhang and Christine Sun. I spent the first seven years of my life in Knoxville, while my parents worked at the [University of Tennessee](https://www.utk.edu/) Textiles and Nonwovens Development Center. Halfway through second grade, when my parents found other work, we moved across the state to Clarksville.

I went to [Kenwood High School](https://kenwoodhigh.cmcss.net/) from 2011 to 2015, where I took part in a pilot "STEM Academy" program that the local school system had concocted. In the end, it wasn't much different from a regular Tennessee high school, but it did afford me the opportunity to take a few classes at [Austin Peay State University](https://apsu.edu/) in 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade. By the time I graduated, I was spending much more of my day at APSU than KHS. I had become friends with some of the math and physics faculty, and they even let me [come along](https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2014/03/31/16-year-old-helps-apsu-math-jeopardy-team-win-second-place-southeast-region/) [on a few](http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2216_abstracts/1097-65-490.pdf) [road trips](https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2015/03/18/apsu-department-of-mathematics-and-statistics-places-first-in-maa-math-jeopardy-competition/).

I spent the next four years of my life at Vanderbilt University, where I majored in math, physics, and computer science --- the nerd trifecta. I was a regular attendant of Vanderbilt's research talks and colloquia, and I even got to [give my own](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/2019/04/deriving-new-runge-kutta-methods-using-unstructured-numerical-search/) as a senior. I won an [Ernest A. Jones Scholarship](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/physics/undergraduate/awards.php) when I was a freshman, a [Goldwater Scholarship](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2017/04/06/three-students-named-goldwater-scholars-for-2017/) when I was a sophomore, and a [Founder's Medal](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/05/10/vanderbilt-honors-class-of-2019-founders-medalists/) when I graduated.

 * My parents did <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19961205)62:10%3C1605::AID-APP12%3E3.0.CO;2-0">machine learning research</a> _way_ before it was cool.
 * I was once the subject of [a real piece of Tennessee state legislation](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/109/Bill/SJR0154.pdf).
 * Yes, my hair is naturally this curly. I don't know how it happened either.
