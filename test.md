The word "commutative" in the term "commutative rng" emphasizes that the *multiplication* operation is commutative. By definition, the addition operation is always commutative in every rng.

**Definition: Field**
:::
::: card-body
A ___field___ is a commutative ring $\alg{K; 0, 1, -, +, \cdot}$ that satisfies the following additional requirements:

 * ___Nontriviality___: $0 \ne 1$.

In abstract algebra, it is common to use the letters $F$ and $K$ to denote an arbitrary field. The letter $K$ comes from "KÃ¶rper," the German word for "field."

**Definition: Vector Space, Vector, Scalar**
:::
::: card-body
Let $\alg{F; 0, 1, -_F, +_F, \cdot_F}$ be a field. A ___vector space___ over $F$ is an algebraic structure $\alg{V; \vo, -_V, +_V, \cdot_V}$ consisting of:

 * a set $V$, called the ___underlying set___;
 * a distinguished element $\vo \in V$, called the ___zero vector___;
 * a unary operation $-_V: V \to V$, written as $\vv \mapsto -\vv$, called ___vector negation___;
 * a binary operation $+_V: V \times V \to V$, written as $(\vv, \vw) \mapsto \vv + \vw$, called ___vector addition___;
 * a binary operation $\cdot_V: F \times V \to V$, written as $(a, \vv) \mapsto a \cdot \vv$, called ___scalar multiplication___;

satisfying the following requirements:

 * ___Additive structure___: $\alg{V; \vo, -_V, +_V}$ is an abelian group.
 * ___Identity___: $1 \cdot \vv = \vv$ for all $\vv \in V$.
 * ___Multiplicative compatibility___: $(a \cdot b) \cdot \vv = a \cdot (b \cdot \vv)$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $\vv \in V$.
 * ___Left distributivity___: $a \cdot (\vv + \vw) = (a \cdot \vv) + (a \cdot \vw)$ for all $a \in F$ and $\vv, \vw \in V$.
 * ___Right distributivity___: $(a + b) \cdot \vv = (a \cdot \vv) + (b \cdot \vv)$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $\vv \in V$.

The elements of $V$ are called ___vectors___, and the elements of $F$ are called ___scalars___.

In these notes, we will use boldface upright letters, such as $\vv$ and $\vw$, to denote vectors. On the other hand, scalars will be denoted by italic letters, such as $a$ and $b$. This will allow us to distinguish vector variables from scalar variables at a glance. (This convention is commonly adopted in physics and engineering, but is uncommon in pure mathematics.)

Adopting this convention also provides another benefit: namely, we no longer need to distinguish between the operations of scalar addition $+_F: F \times F \to F$ and vector addition $+_V: V \times V \to V$. Instead, we proceed with the implicit understanding that whenever the $+$ sign occurs between two scalars, as in $a + b$, it refers to scalar addition. Likewise, whenever it occurs between two vectors, as in $\vv + \vw$, it refers to vector addition.

The same goes for the two multiplication operations $\cdot_F: F \times F \to F$ and $\cdot_V: F \times V \to V$. Moving forward, these operations will be denoted by juxtaposition, as in $ab$ and $a\vv$. The requirement of multiplicative compatibility allows us to write $ab\vv$ without ambiguity, and the identity property allows us to freely insert and omit factors of $1$.

As with groups, rings, and fields, it is common to denote a vector space $\alg{V; \vo_V, -_V, +_V, \cdot_V}$ simply by the name of its underlying set $V$. Thus, we will often say "let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$."

**Definition: Linear Combination**
:::
::: card-body
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$, and let $n \in \N$. A ___linear combination___ of a finite collection of vectors $\vv_1, \vv_2, \dots, \vv_n \in V$ is a vector of the form

$$ a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + a_n \vv_n $$

where $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in F$. We call the scalars $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ the ___coefficients___ of the linear combination. If $n = 0$, we define the unique linear combination of an empty collection of vectors to be $\vo$.

**Definition: Span**
:::
::: card-body
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$. The ___span___ of a subset $S \subseteq V$, denoted by $\vspan S$, is the set of all linear combinations of all finite sequences of vectors in $S$.

$$ \vspan S \coloneqq \{ a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + a_n \vv_n : n \in \N,\ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in F,\ \vv_1, \vv_2, \dots, \vv_n \in S \} $$
:::
::::::

Because we defined $\vo$ to be the unique linear combination of an empty set of vectors, we always have $\vo \in \vspan S$ for *any* subset $S \subseteq V$, including the empty set.
