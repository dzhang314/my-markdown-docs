**Definition: Domain**
:::
::: card-body
A ___domain___ is a nontrivial ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is itself nonzero.
:::
::::::

In other words, a domain is a ring that does not contain any (left or right) zero divisors except $0$ itself. The most well-studied domains happen to be commutative rings, so there is a special term for a commutative domain.

**Definition: Integral Domain**
:::
::: card-body
An ___integral domain___ is a nontrivial commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is itself nonzero.

**Definition: Principal Ideal, Generator**
:::
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $r \in R$. The ___principal ideal___ generated by $r$, denoted by $\gen{r}$, is the subset of $R$ containing all multiples of $r$.

$$ \gen{r} \coloneqq \{ rx : x \in R \} $$

An ideal $I \normalin R$ is ___principal___ if there exists an element $r \in R$ such that $I = \gen{r}$. In this case, we call $r$ a ___generator___ of $I$.
:::
::::::

Note that a principal ideal may have more than one generator. For example, the ideal of even numbers in $\Z$ has two generators, $\gen{2} = \gen{-2}$. In a commutative ring with zero divisors, it can even be the case that a single principal ideal has multiple generators which are not associate to each other.

**Two Generators of the Same Ideal in an Integral Domain are Associates**
:::
::: card-body
**Theorem:** Let $R$ be an integral domain. If two elements $a, b \in R$ generate the same ideal $\gen{a} = \gen{b}$, then $a$ and $b$ are associates.
:::
------
::: card-body
*Proof:* If $\gen{a} = \gen{b} = \{0\}$, then $a = b = 0$, and we are done, since $0$ is certainly associate to itself. Otherwise, $a$ and $b$ are both nonzero. The hypothesis $\gen{a} = \gen{b}$ implies that $a \in \gen{b}$ and $b \in \gen{a}$. Thus, there exist $r, s \in R$ such that $a = rb$ and $b = sa$. It follows that $a = rsa$, or equivalently, $(1 - rs)a = 0$. Since $R$ is an integral domain and $a \ne 0$, we must have $1 - rs = 0$, which shows that $r$ and $s$ are both units in $R$. We therefore conclude from the defining condition $a = rb$ that $a$ and $b$ are associates. <span class="float-end">&#8718;</span>

**Definition: Principal Ideal Domain (PID)**
:::
::: card-body
A ___principal ideal domain___, also known as a ___PID___, is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.

**Definition: Divides, Divisibility Relation, $a \mid b$**
:::
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a commutative rng, and let $a, b \in R$. We say that $a$ ___divides___ $b$, denoted by $a \mid b$, if there exists an element $q \in R$ such that $b = qa$. This binary relation ${\mid} \subseteq R \times R$ is called the ___divisibility relation___ on $R$.
:::
::::::

The divisibility relation $\mid$ is always reflexive in a ring, but can fail to be reflexive in a rng. Note that $0$ does not divide any element of a rng except $0$, but every element of a rng divides $0$.


:::::: card
::: card-header
**Divisibility is Transitive**
:::
::: card-body
**Theorem:** The divisibility relation on any rng is transitive.
:::
------
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a rng, and let $a, b, c \in R$. If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then there exist $x, y \in R$ sch that $b = xa$ and $c = yb$. It follows that $c = yxa$, which proves that $a \mid c$. <span class="float-end">&#8718;</span>

**Definition: Prime Element**
:::
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. An element $p \in R$ is ___prime___ if $p \notin R^\times \cup \{0\}$ and for all $a, b \in R$, if $p \mid ab$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.
:::
::::::

The prime elements of the commutative ring $\Z$ are precisely the usual prime numbers $2, 3, 5, 7, \dots$ and their negatives.

**Definition: Irreducible Element**
:::
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a ring. An element $r \in R$ is ___irreducible___ if $r \notin R^\times$ and for all $a, b \in R$, if $r = ab$, then $a \in R^\times$ or $b \in R^\times$.
:::
::::::

Note that, while the notion of an irreducible element is defined in any ring, the notion of a prime element is only defined in a *commutative* ring.

**Definition: Characteristic, $\fchar R$**
:::
::: card-body
Let $R$ be a ring. The ___characteristic___ of $R$, denoted by $\fchar R$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that

$$ \underbrace{1_R + 1_R + \cdots + 1_R}_{n \text{ copies of } 1_R} = 0_R. $$

If no such $n$ exists, then we define $\fchar R \coloneqq 0$.
:::
::::::

For example, $\fchar \Z = 0$ and $\fchar(\Z / 4\Z) = 4$.
